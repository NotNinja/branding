## Using Assets

All assets are owned by !ninja and intended for use by !ninja, however, we are an open organization so if you wish to
use our assets, simply ask us for permission to do so, detailing who/what/when/where/why you intend to use them.

The best way to get in touch with us is via [email](mailto:contact@not.ninja) or on [slack](https://slack.not.ninja).

## Generating Assets

The majority of the assets are generated by a script using the SVG files as the source, all of which are currently coded
manually (because we're cool like that). The notable exceptions being the
[social assets](https://github.com/NotNinja/branding/blob/master/docs/assets.md#social) which are maintained manually,
for now.

Here's a simple breakdown of what the script does:

1. Reads `assets/manifest.json` file
2. Converts each SVG file (excluding `*.min.svg`) to PNG files for each size detailed in the manifest under `svg2png`
3. Converts each PNG file to ICO files for all of the recommended sizes as detailed in the manifest under `png2ico`
4. Creates an optimized version (`*.min.svg`) of all SVG files under the `assets` directory

To work with assets, you really just need to follow the existing directory structures and ensure that both the
`assets/manifest.json` and `docs/assets.md` are synchronized with the asset sources.

In order to run the script to generate the assets, you first need to checkout the code. For this, you'll need to ensure
that you have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed. Once you have that installed, you can get the code via the
following:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/NotNinja/branding.git notninja-branding
$ cd notninja-branding
```

Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 6 or above installed, which will also include the
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) command-line tool that we need. Now you just need to install of the dependencies for the
script by running the following command:

``` bash
notninja-branding$ npm install
```

Now, any time that you need to generate assets you just need to run the following:

``` bash
notninja-branding$ npm start
```

If successful, it should end with "Done!".

If you'd like to learn more about any of the software mentioned above, you can read their online documentation:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/doc)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
