# Guidelines

This document contains guidelines to be followed when representing the !ninja brand.

1. [Fonts](https://github.com/NotNinja/branding/tree/master/docs%2Fguidelines.md#fonts)

## Fonts

The following fonts are recommended to be used when presenting text-based information, anywhere from websites to written letters:

| Type | Primary Font | Fallback Fonts |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Heading | TODO | TODO |
| Body | TODO | TODO |
| Monospace | TODO | TODO |

For all assets, our unique bespoke font should always be used. This does not exist as a standalone font (yet?) and, instead, SVG characters are currently simply being copied throughout the assets, as needed. We will attempt to improve this going forward to make it easier to reuse and widen its usage.
